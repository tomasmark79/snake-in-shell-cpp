# Snake In Shell

Snake in shell was my first C++ OOP language excercise some time ago and it is a game inspired by the classic Snake game. This game is happening in a text console and is drawing with ansi chars. The game supports singleplayer, multiplayer like a hotseat up to four players or network multiplayer via UDP up to two players. The game does not meet the requirements for modern OOP in C++. Use it at your own risc!
